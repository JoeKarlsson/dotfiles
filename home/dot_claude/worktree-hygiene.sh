# SessionStart hook: tidy the Claude worktrees in .claude/worktrees/.
#
# One worktree per concurrent session (global CLAUDE.md rule) means they pile up:
# a session that crashed, or exited with "keep", leaves its worktree, its branch
# and its copied credentials (.worktreeinclude) behind. On every session start:
#   - skip a worktree whose owning session is still running (the lock Claude
#     Code writes names its pid)
#   - REMOVE one that is clean, has no commits missing from origin's default
#     branch, and was last touched over IDLE_MIN minutes ago (default 60): nothing
#     in it can be lost, and the hour only guards a worktree a session is still
#     setting up
#   - REPORT one older than STALE_DAYS that still holds uncommitted changes or
#     unpushed commits, so a person decides
#   - git worktree prune (drops records of worktree dirs already deleted)
# Never fetches (must stay fast) and never touches the main checkout. Silent
# unless it did or found something.
